# ðŸ§  Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (2nd Edition)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains my detailed notes, code notebooks, and mini-projects from *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow (2nd Edition)* by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron.  
Each chapter includes Python-based hands-on implementations focusing on end-to-end ML workflows, deep learning, and TensorFlow.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Build deep practical understanding of ML workflows and pipelines.  
- Implement every chapter in Python notebooks.  
- Practice model evaluation, optimization, and interpretability.  
- Reproduce key projects using real-world datasets.
